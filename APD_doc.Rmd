```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# This first code pane is for loading important libraries.

library(rioja)
library(vegan)
library(wesanderson)

# You can also add important functions that you plan to use.

zscore <-function(y1) {
  n1 <- mean(y1)
  n2 <- sd(y1)
  zscore <- (y1-n1)/n2

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
