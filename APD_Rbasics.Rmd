## APD Workshop Series: R Basics for Paleoecologists

This is meant to be a simple guide to help otherwise busy paleoecologists make use of some helpful tools for conducting research and publishing. All the while, you will also be making your work reproducible.

### Required Software

For this workshop we will be using two separate, but related pieces of software: R and R Studio. R is a standalone open-source software package for statistical analysis. It is both a programming language and an environment within which you can use the language to execute commands. R is an instantiation of a tiny universe with rules, many of which you do not know. R Studio is a wrapper for R that allows us to see a bit more of what is going on inside of R.

**First**, you need to install R from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/). Click this link or the logo below, at the top of the page you will find a section titled "Download and Install R" and choose the appropriate download for your operating system.

It should look something like this:

```{r screenshot of R main site, echo=FALSE, fig.align= 'center', fig.cap= "cran.R-project website landing page."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cran_page.jpg")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
