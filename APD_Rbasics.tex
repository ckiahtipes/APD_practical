This is meant to be a simple guide to help otherwise busy
paleoecologists make use of some helpful tools for conducting research
and publishing. All the while, you will also be making your work
reproducible.\\

For this workshop we will be using two separate, but related pieces of
open-source software: R and R Studio.\\
\strut \\
R is a standalone open-source software for statistical analysis. It has
an interesting history (you can find more here), but it is \emph{both} a
programming language and an environment within which you can use the
language to execute commands. Thus, it is described as the ``R
Statistical Computing Environment''. R is an instantiation of a tiny
universe with many rules, few (or none!) of which you know.\\
\strut \\
R Studio is a wrapper for R that allows us to see a bit more of what is
going on inside of R and to control it through the window rather than
exclusively through the ``console''. R Studio knows the rules so you
don't have to. Much like a spell-checker in word processing, R Studio
checks your code for you. More on this later.\\

\hypertarget{installing-r-statistical-computing-environment}{%
\paragraph{Installing R Statistical Computing
Environment}\label{installing-r-statistical-computing-environment}}

\hfill\break

\textbf{First}, you need to install R from
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{cran.r-project.org}. Click this link
or the logo below, at the top of the page you will find a section titled
``Download and Install R'' and choose the appropriate download for your
operating system (OS).

\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth,height=\textheight]{https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg}}

It should look something like this:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/cran_page} 

}

\caption{**Figure 1**. cran.R-project website landing page.}\label{fig:screenshot of R main site}
\end{figure}

Once you've selected the R version for your OS, you'll be given some
download options. Select ``base'' and download the .exe file (Windows).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/cran_download} 

}

\caption{**Figure 2.** cran.R-project windows download options, select 'base'.}\label{fig:screenshot of download options}
\end{figure}

Double-click on this file and follow the instructions from your
machine's prompts for installation. This differs slightly between each
operating system and the version of the operating system you're using.

If you're using macOS, you will be directed to a slightly different
looking page with multiple download options. Here, you much choose a
package based on the version of the macOS you're using. If you're using
OS 11 or greater (Apple names their updates, so this one is `Big Sur')
select the top option. If you're using versions before this (`High
Sierra'), then download the second option.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/cran_macDL} 

}

\caption{**Figure 3.** cran.R-project macOS download options}\label{fig:screenshot of macOS DL options}
\end{figure}

For windows users, R will install to your ``program files'' folder. For
macOS users, you will need to move the R.app folder from the package
(once opened) and drag it into your applications folder.

\hypertarget{introduction-to-r-syntax-objects-and-functions}{%
\paragraph{Introduction to R Syntax, Objects, and
Functions}\label{introduction-to-r-syntax-objects-and-functions}}

\textbf{Second}, let's open up R to make sure that it works and to look
at some important features that will help you later on. When you open R,
you only get a text window called the console. This is where all of the
action happens and as soon as you open R, you're given some basic, but
important information.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/R_console} 

}

\caption{**Figure 4.** R Console with annotations for working directory, version, and citation instructions.}\label{fig:screenshot of R console running solo}
\end{figure}

Note the following: -the \emph{working directory} is folder where R
looks when it goes to find or write things. -the software version is at
the top of the initialization text, this information is important for
citations. -the intialization text includes instructions for getting
information about licensing, help, and for citing R.

We can actually try out a bit of coding at this point. Try entering the
following into the console and hitting enter.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{citation}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This can also be written as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{citation}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"base"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Both these commands give us the same result.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## To cite R in publications use:
## 
##   R Core Team (2022). R: A language and environment for statistical
##   computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
##   URL https://www.R-project.org/.
## 
## A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is
## 
##   @Manual{,
##     title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
##     author = {{R Core Team}},
##     organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
##     address = {Vienna, Austria},
##     year = {2022},
##     url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
##   }
## 
## We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it
## when using it for data analysis. See also 'citation("pkgname")' for
## citing R packages.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Congratulations!} If this is your first time using R, then you
just ran your first command!

Note that ``base'' gives us the same output because the R Statistical
Computing Environment comes with a lot of basic functions (hence
``base'') that it can do. Later, we will explore how we can expand R
with ``packages'' written and maintained by other users.

There is a bit of vocabulary to know that will help you use R.
\emph{Commands} are any instructions you give to R in the console. You
enter text after the ``\textgreater{}'' sign in the console and hit on
the keyboard to give R commands. The R environment runs primarily by
creating \emph{objects} and applying \emph{functions} to them. In order
for R to do things with an object, it has to know that it exists.

All coding languages run on \emph{syntax} (rules for combining things
for communication). Here's some key symbols in R syntax.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rr@{}}
\toprule()
Syntax & Action \\
\midrule()
\endhead
= & equals sign is used to assign data to objects \\
\textless- & arrow is the same as equals sign, assigns data to
objects \\
\# & hashes designate non-coding regions, used to annotate code \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Here, we use "=" to create an object called "x" and assign it the value of 5.}

\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{installing-r-studio}{%
\paragraph{Installing R Studio}\label{installing-r-studio}}

\textbf{Third}, you will need to
\href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{download R Studio} and
install it. R Studio is available as a ``free version'' and a
``professional'' version. The links here go directly to the free
version.

\href{https://posit.co/downloads/}{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth,height=\textheight]{https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/57299a1dcd979c623325f11bf5e5ce60f3d4eb00/e4602/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/black.png}}

The webpage should detect what machine you're using and suggest the
correct version of R Studio. If it does not, there are other download
options below which correspond to various OS and OS versions. You will
notice that the webpage also tells you to install R (which we've already
done), so you can skip to ``2'' and download R Studio.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/R_studio-DL} 

}

\caption{**Figure 5.** R Studio Download Page.}\label{fig:sceenshot of R Studio Download page}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{including-plots}{%
\subsection{Including Plots}\label{including-plots}}

You can also embed plots, for example:

\includegraphics{APD_Rbasics_files/figure-latex/pressure-1.pdf}

Note that the \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} parameter was added to the code
chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
